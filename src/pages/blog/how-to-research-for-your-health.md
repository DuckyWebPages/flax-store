Welcome to our blog! Finding solid health info is tougher than it looksâ€¦

We are not allowed to tell you all the things our products do without being accused of making claims. We use FDA Compliant language that talks about what systems the products support. We recommend that you learn how to do solid research (for yourself and your family)! Here are some ways you can do it:

1. Go to Pubmed.gov and search the name of the product or ingredient you are looking into. Try combining that ingredient with terms like "cancer" or "HIV" or "Diabetes". Pubmed.gov is a website where scientists publish their research and you have access. So, as an example, you could search the terms "flax lignans cancer" and about 150 research papers will come up that you can look through. These are great for making your own health decisions and for presenting to your own doctor (who probably doesn't have time to look this kind of thing up.)
2. ChatGPT.com is another resource. You can ask a question like, "Is there any research out there on diabetes and flax lignans?" Or, "Does Brown Laminara seaweed detox people from heavy metals?"
3. Try Perplexity Deep Research search engine/AI. https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research  It is focused on research, so you can ask questions like, "Please give me all the newest research on breast cancer and flax lignans."
4. Visit Aidshivawareness.org (a non-profit organization) and click on their "Research" tab to learn more about many of the products we carry on this website. They also publish protocols for natural health solutions.


Don't be afraid. Listen to your inner voice. Discuss research with your doctors (or not - it is your body). 
We are not responsible for your health, your health choices and can't know how any of the products on our website will react with your body. The FDA has not approved of anything we say or do on this website. We research and find natural health solutions that have helped others, and try to pass those along to others.
