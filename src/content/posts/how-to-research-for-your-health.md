BLOG ARTICLE **RESEARCHING YOUR OWN HEALTH SOLUTIONS**!

We are not allowed to tell you all the things our products do without being accused of making claims. We use FDA-compliant language that talks about what systems the products support. We recommend that you learn how to do solid research (for yourself and your family)! Here are some ways you can do it:

1. Go to PubMed.gov and search the name of the product or ingredient you’re looking into. Try combining that ingredient with terms like “cancer” or “diabetes.”
2. Try searching the same terms on Perplexity.ai - a search engine designed around research.
3. Go to Aidshivawareness.org and click on their "Research" tab to see research on qa lot of products from this website.
